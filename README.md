## Architecture and design choices

The goal was to create a highly customizable notifications while at the same time allow ease of usage with some sensible defaults.
This library also support showing multiple notifications, even with different styles, at the same time.

As such, there are multiple ways you can show a notification:

- using helper "API" methods such as showRoundedTextNotification, showMaterialStyleTextNotification, showErrorNotifications and others.
  Even when using these helper methods, you can still further customize the look of the notification if you want.

- Using the more generic showNotification method which allows you to customize all aspects of the notification.

- using the showNotification method and providing it with your own UI element as notification. This allows you to create a totally new notification UI while still enjoying the animations, dislay/hide infrastructure of this library.
  You can also use the BeautifulNotification element as a starting point for your own UI.

## How to use this library?

All you need to do is render a Billboard component somewhere in your app tree, ideally somewhere in the top.
Then simply use one of the API methods to add notifications to it. The Billboard will be display above all of your app UI and will hide itself automatically when there are no notifications to show.

```js
import {
    Billboard,
    NOTIFICATIONS_POSITION,
} from '@farfarawaylabs/react-native-beautiful-notifications';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Billboard position={NOTIFICATIONS_POSITION.TOP} />
    </View>
  );
```

### Usage with React Navigation

if you are using React Navigation version 5 and above, there is a weird bug with Android that hides absolute positioned elements above the NavigationContainer. Luckliy there is an easy fix. Simply put your Billboard after the NavigationContainer instead of before.

```js
import {
  Billboard,
  NOTIFICATIONS_POSITION,
} from '@farfarawaylabs/react-native-beautiful-notifications';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <NavigationContainer>
        <Stack.Navigator>
          <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        </Stack.Navigator>
      </NavigationContainer>
      <Billboard />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Customization

You can customize most notifications with the following props (see exmaple project for exmaple code). All the props has some default values so you can decide what to customize and what to leave as is.

- text: The text of the notification. If you pass this prop, the notificationUI one will be ignored

- textStyle: Additional styles to attach to the text element of the notification

- width: The notification component width

- autoDisappearTime: The number of milliseconds after which the notification will auto disappear. 0 means it will stay until the user press it.

- entranceAnimationType: The type of animation to be used when showing the notification. Default to fadeIn animation.

- entranceAnimationDuration: the duration of the entrance animation in miliseconds.

- exitAnimationType: The type of animation to be used when hiding the notification.

- exitAnimationDuration: the duration of the exit animation in miliseconds.

- notificationUI: Pass your own custom notification element. If this prop is passed, the text prop will be ignored

- style: Additional styles to attach to the notification component
